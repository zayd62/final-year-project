	shorttitle = {Seq2SQL},
	abstract = {A significant amount of the world's knowledge is stored in relational databases. However, the ability for users to retrieve facts from a database is limited due to a lack of understanding of query languages such as {SQL}. We propose Seq2SQL, a deep neural network for translating natural language questions to corresponding {SQL} queries. Our model leverages the structure of {SQL} queries to significantly reduce the output space of generated queries. Moreover, we use rewards from in-the-loop query execution over the database to learn a policy to generate unordered parts of the query, which we show are less suitable for optimization via cross entropy loss. In addition, we will publish {WikiSQL}, a dataset of 80654 hand-annotated examples of questions and {SQL} queries distributed across 24241 tables from Wikipedia. This dataset is required to train our model and is an order of magnitude larger than comparable datasets. By applying policy-based reinforcement learning with a query execution environment to {WikiSQL}, our model Seq2SQL outperforms attentional sequence to sequence models, improving execution accuracy from 35.9\% to 59.4\% and logical form accuracy from 23.4\% to 48.3\%.},

	abstract = {Semantic parsing aims at mapping natural language utterances into structured meaning representations. In this work, we propose a structure-aware neural architecture which decomposes the semantic parsing process into two stages. Given an input utterance, we first generate a rough sketch of its meaning, where low-level information (such as variable names and arguments) is glossed over. Then, we fill in missing details by taking into account the natural language input and the sketch itself. Experimental results on four datasets characteristic of different domains and meaning representations show that our approach consistently improves performance, achieving competitive results despite the use of relatively simple decoders.},

	abstract = {Object/Relational Mapping ({ORM}) provides a methodology and mechanism for object-oriented systems to hold their long-term data safely in a database, with transactional control over it, yet have it expressed when needed in program objects. Instead of bundles of special code for this, {ORM} encourages models and use of constraints for the application, which then runs in a context set up by the {ORM}. Today's web applications are particularly well-suited to this approach, as they are necessarily multithreaded and thus are prone to race conditions unless the interaction with the database is very carefully implemented. The {ORM} approach was first realized in Hibernate, an open source project for Java systems started in 2002, and this year is joined by Microsoft's Entity Data Model for .{NET} systems. Both are described here.},
